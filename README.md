Welcome to the Prodigy InfoTech Internship repository! This repository documents Task 2 of the internship, which focuses on building a To-Do List app for Android.

## Task Overview

The objective of this task is to develop a To-Do List app for Android that allows users to:
- **Add** tasks
- **Edit** tasks
- **Delete** tasks

## Steps

1. **Setup Project**:
   - Create a new Android project in Android Studio.
   - Configure project settings including project name, package name, and target SDK.

2. **Design UI**:
   - Implement the user interface for the To-Do List app using XML.
   - Include an `EditText` for task input, a `Button` to add tasks, and a `ListView` to display the tasks.
   - Design a layout for list items that includes text for the task and buttons for editing and deleting tasks.

3. **Implement Logic**:
   - Write Java code in `MainActivity.java` to handle adding, editing, and deleting tasks.
   - Implement logic to manage the list of tasks, handle user interactions, and update the UI accordingly.
   - Ensure that the app handles task editing and deletion correctly, and updates the UI to reflect changes.

4. **Write Tests**:
   - Develop instrumented tests to verify the app’s functionality and correctness.
   - Create test cases to validate adding, editing, and deleting tasks.
   - Use Espresso for UI testing to ensure that the app behaves as expected under various scenarios.

5. **Build & Run**:
   - Compile the app using Android Studio and resolve any build issues.
   - Test the app on an Android device or emulator to ensure it operates as expected.
   - Verify that all functionalities work correctly and that the app handles user input gracefully.

## Knowledge Gained

- **Android Application Development**:
  - Gained practical experience in setting up and managing an Android app project.
  - Learned how to use Android Studio for development and debugging.

- **User Interface (UI) Design**:
  - Acquired skills in designing intuitive and functional user interfaces for mobile applications.
  - Implemented layouts using XML to create a responsive and user-friendly interface for managing tasks.

- **Handling Task Operations**:
  - Developed logic to handle adding, editing, and deleting tasks.
  - Implemented functionality to manage task states and user interactions effectively.

- **Testing in Android**:
  - Developed skills in creating and executing instrumented tests using Espresso.
  - Ensured the app’s reliability and functionality through rigorous testing.

## Summary

This task involved the development of a To-Do List app for Android, covering the following aspects:
- **Project Setup**: Configured and initialized an Android project.
- **UI Design**: Designed and implemented a user-friendly interface for managing tasks using XML.
- **Logic Implementation**: Developed the core logic to add, edit, and delete tasks, and manage user interactions.
- **Testing**: Created and ran instrumented tests to validate the app’s functionality and correctness.

The provided instrumented tests confirm that the app’s context is correctly configured and that core functionalities are operational.

## Conclusion

The task successfully demonstrated the fundamental steps required to build a To-Do List app for Android, including:
- Effective design and implementation of the user interface.
- Development of core functionalities for managing tasks.
- Application of testing practices to ensure app reliability.
